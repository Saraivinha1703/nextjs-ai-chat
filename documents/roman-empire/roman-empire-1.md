# Roman Empire

The **Roman Empire** was the post-[Republican](/wiki/Roman_Republic 'Roman Republic') state of [ancient Rome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome 'Ancient Rome') and is generally understood to mean the period, and the territory ruled by the [Romans](/wiki/Roman_people 'Roman people') following [Octavian](/wiki/Octavian 'Octavian')\'s assumption of sole rule under the [Principate](/wiki/Principate 'Principate') in 31 BC. It included territory around the [Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea 'Mediterranean Sea') in [Europe](/wiki/Europe 'Europe'), [North Africa](/wiki/North_Africa 'North Africa'), and [Western Asia](/wiki/Western_Asia 'Western Asia'), eventually extending as far north as Northern Europe, and was ruled by [emperors](/wiki/Roman_emperor 'Roman emperor'). The adoption of Christianity as the [state church](/wiki/Christianity_as_the_Roman_state_religion 'Christianity as the Roman state religion') in 380 and the [fall of the Western Roman Empire](/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire 'Fall of the Western Roman Empire') conventionally marks the end of [classical antiquity](/wiki/Classical_antiquity 'Classical antiquity') and the beginning of the [Middle Ages](/wiki/Middle_Ages 'Middle Ages').

Rome had expanded its rule to most of the Mediterranean and beyond, but became severely destabilized in [civil wars and political conflicts](/wiki/List_of_Roman_civil_wars_and_revolts 'List of Roman civil wars and revolts') which culminated in the [victory of Octavian](/wiki/Wars_of_Augustus 'Wars of Augustus') over [Mark Antony](/wiki/Mark_Antony 'Mark Antony') and [Cleopatra](/wiki/Cleopatra 'Cleopatra') at the [Battle of Actium](/wiki/Battle_of_Actium 'Battle of Actium') in 31 BC and the subsequent conquest of the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom 'Ptolemaic Kingdom') in Egypt. The [Roman Senate](/wiki/Roman_Senate 'Roman Senate') granted Octavian overarching power (_[imperium](/wiki/Imperium 'Imperium')_) and the new title of _[Augustus](</wiki/Augustus_(title)> 'Augustus (title)')\_, marking his [accession as the first Roman emperor](/wiki/Constitutional_reforms_of_Augustus 'Constitutional reforms of Augustus') of a [monarchy](/wiki/Principate 'Principate') with [Rome](/wiki/Rome 'Rome') as its sole capital. The vast Roman territories were organized in [senatorial](/wiki/Senatorial_province 'Senatorial province') and [imperial](/wiki/Imperial_province 'Imperial province') provinces.

The [first two centuries of the Empire](/wiki/History_of_the_Roman_Empire 'History of the Roman Empire') saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [Pax Romana](/wiki/Pax_Romana 'Pax Romana') (lit.[ ]\'Roman Peace\'). Rome reached its [greatest territorial expanse](/wiki/Borders_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Borders of the Roman Empire') under [Trajan](/wiki/Trajan 'Trajan') (AD 98--117); a period of increasing trouble and decline began under [Commodus](/wiki/Commodus 'Commodus') (180--192). In the 3rd century, the Empire underwent a [crisis](/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century 'Crisis of the Third Century') that threatened its existence, as the [Gallic](/wiki/Gallic_Empire 'Gallic Empire') and [Palmyrene](/wiki/Palmyrene_Empire 'Palmyrene Empire') Empires broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [short-lived emperors](/wiki/Barracks_emperor 'Barracks emperor') led the Empire. It was reunified under [Aurelian](/wiki/Aurelian 'Aurelian'). [Diocletian](/wiki/Diocletian 'Diocletian') set up two different imperial courts in the [Greek East and Latin West](/wiki/Greek_East_and_Latin_West 'Greek East and Latin West') in 286; [Christians rose to power](/wiki/Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity 'Constantine the Great and Christianity') in the 4th century following the [Edict of Milan](/wiki/Edict_of_Milan 'Edict of Milan'). The imperial seat moved from Rome to [Byzantium](/wiki/Names_of_Istanbul 'Names of Istanbul') in 330, renamed [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople 'Constantinople') after [Constantine the Great](/wiki/Constantine_the_Great 'Constantine the Great'). The [Migration Period](/wiki/Migration_Period 'Migration Period'), involving [large invasions by Germanic peoples](/wiki/Germanic%E2%80%93Roman_contacts 'Germanic–Roman contacts') and by the [Huns](/wiki/Huns 'Huns') of [Attila](/wiki/Attila 'Attila'), led to the decline of the [Western Roman Empire](/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire 'Western Roman Empire'). With the [fall of Ravenna](</wiki/Battle_of_Ravenna_(476)> 'Battle of Ravenna (476)') to the [Germanic Herulians](/wiki/Heruli 'Heruli') and the [deposition of Romulus Augustus](/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustus 'Deposition of Romulus Augustus') in 476 by Odoacer, the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed. The [Eastern Roman Empire](/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire 'Eastern Roman Empire') survived for another millennium with Constantinople as its sole capital, until the city\'s [fall](/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople 'Fall of Constantinople') in 1453.

Due to the Empire\'s extent and endurance, its institutions and culture had [a lasting influence](/wiki/Legacy_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Legacy of the Roman Empire') on the development of [language](/wiki/History_of_Latin 'History of Latin'), [religion](/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome 'Religion in ancient Rome'), [art](/wiki/Roman_art 'Roman art'), [architecture](/wiki/Ancient_Roman_architecture 'Ancient Roman architecture'), [literature](/wiki/Latin_literature 'Latin literature'), [philosophy](/wiki/Ancient_Roman_philosophy 'Ancient Roman philosophy'), [law](/wiki/Roman_law 'Roman law'), and [forms of government](/wiki/Roman_magistrate 'Roman magistrate') in its territories. [Latin](/wiki/Latin 'Latin') evolved into the [Romance languages](/wiki/Romance_languages 'Romance languages'), while [Medieval Greek](/wiki/History_of_Greek 'History of Greek') became the language of the East. The Empire\'s [adoption of Christianity](/wiki/History_of_Christianity 'History of Christianity') led to the formation of medieval [Christendom](/wiki/Christendom 'Christendom'). Roman and [Greek art](/wiki/Ancient_Greek_art 'Ancient Greek art') had a profound impact on the [Italian Renaissance](/wiki/Italian_Renaissance 'Italian Renaissance'). Rome\'s architectural tradition served as the basis for [Romanesque](/wiki/Romanesque_architecture 'Romanesque architecture'), [Renaissance](/wiki/Renaissance_architecture 'Renaissance architecture') and [Neoclassical architecture](/wiki/Neoclassical_architecture 'Neoclassical architecture'), and influenced [Islamic architecture](/wiki/Islamic_architecture 'Islamic architecture'). The rediscovery of [classical science](/wiki/Science_in_classical_antiquity 'Science in classical antiquity') and [technology](/wiki/Ancient_Roman_technology 'Ancient Roman technology') (which formed the basis for [Islamic science](/wiki/Science_in_the_medieval_Islamic_world 'Science in the medieval Islamic world')) in medieval Europe led to the [Scientific Renaissance](/wiki/Science_in_the_Renaissance 'Science in the Renaissance') and [Scientific Revolution](/wiki/Scientific_Revolution 'Scientific Revolution'). Many modern legal systems, such as the [Napoleonic Code](/wiki/Napoleonic_Code 'Napoleonic Code'), descend from Roman law, while Rome\'s republican institutions have [influenced](/wiki/Classical_tradition 'Classical tradition') the [Italian city-state republics](/wiki/Maritime_republics 'Maritime republics') of the medieval period, the early [United States](/wiki/United_States 'United States'), and modern democratic republics.

### Transition from Republic to Empire

Further information: [Roman Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic 'Roman Republic')

Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the [Roman Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic 'Roman Republic') in the 6th century BC, though not outside the Italian peninsula until the 3rd century BC. Thus, it was an \"empire\" (a great power) long before it had an emperor. The Republic was not a nation-state in the modern sense, but a network of self-ruled towns (with varying degrees of independence from the [Senate](/wiki/Roman_Senate 'Roman Senate')) and provinces administered by military commanders. It was governed by annually elected [magistrates](/wiki/Roman_magistrate 'Roman magistrate') ([Roman consuls](/wiki/Roman_consul 'Roman consul') above all) in conjunction with the Senate. The 1st century BC was a time of political and military upheaval, which ultimately led to rule by emperors. The consuls\' military power rested in the Roman legal concept of _[imperium](/wiki/Imperium 'Imperium')_, meaning \"command\" (though typically in a military sense). Occasionally, successful consuls were given the honorary title _[imperator](/wiki/Imperator 'Imperator')_ (commander); this is the origin of the word _emperor_, since this title was always bestowed to the early emperors.

Rome suffered a long series of internal conflicts, conspiracies, and [civil wars](/wiki/Roman_civil_wars 'Roman civil wars') from the late second century BC---[Crisis of the Roman Republic](/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Roman_Republic 'Crisis of the Roman Republic')---while greatly extending its power beyond Italy. In 44 BC, [Julius Caesar](/wiki/Julius_Caesar 'Julius Caesar') was briefly perpetual [dictator](/wiki/Roman_dictator 'Roman dictator') before being [assassinated](/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar 'Assassination of Julius Caesar'). The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [Battle of Philippi](/wiki/Battle_of_Philippi 'Battle of Philippi') in 42 BC by [Mark Antony](/wiki/Mark_Antony 'Mark Antony') and Caesar\'s adopted son [Octavian](/wiki/Augustus 'Augustus'). Antony and Octavian\'s division of the Roman world did not last and Octavian\'s forces defeated those of Mark Antony and [Cleopatra](/wiki/Cleopatra 'Cleopatra') at the [Battle of Actium](/wiki/Battle_of_Actium 'Battle of Actium') in 31 BC. In 27 BC the [Senate](/wiki/Roman_Senate 'Roman Senate') made Octavian _[princeps](/wiki/Princeps 'Princeps')_ (\"first citizen\") with [proconsular](/wiki/Proconsul 'Proconsul') _[imperium](/wiki/Imperium 'Imperium')_, thus beginning the [Principate](/wiki/Principate 'Principate') (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the title _[Augustus](</wiki/Augustus_(title)> 'Augustus (title)')_ (\"the venerated\"). Although the republic stood in name, Augustus had all meaningful authority. Since his rule began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch _[de facto](/wiki/De_facto 'De facto')_ if not _[de jure](/wiki/De_jure 'De jure')\_. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order operated as before when [Tiberius](/wiki/Tiberius 'Tiberius') was accepted as the new emperor.

### _Pax Romana_

Main article: [Pax Romana](/wiki/Pax_Romana 'Pax Romana')

The 200 years that began with Augustus\'s rule is traditionally regarded as the _[Pax Romana](/wiki/Pax_Romana 'Pax Romana')_ (\"Roman Peace\"). The cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced. Uprisings in the provinces were infrequent and put down \"mercilessly and swiftly\". The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs. The [Julio-Claudian dynasty](/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty 'Julio-Claudian dynasty') lasted for four more emperors---[Tiberius](/wiki/Tiberius 'Tiberius'), [Caligula](/wiki/Caligula 'Caligula'), [Claudius](/wiki/Claudius 'Claudius'), and [Nero](/wiki/Nero 'Nero')---before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife-torn [Year of the Four Emperors](/wiki/Year_of_the_Four_Emperors 'Year of the Four Emperors'), from which [Vespasian](/wiki/Vespasian 'Vespasian') emerged as victor. Vespasian became the founder of the brief [Flavian dynasty](/wiki/Flavian_dynasty 'Flavian dynasty'), followed by the [Nerva--Antonine dynasty](/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty 'Nerva–Antonine dynasty') which produced the \"[Five Good Emperors](/wiki/Five_Good_Emperors 'Five Good Emperors')\": [Nerva](/wiki/Nerva 'Nerva'), [Trajan](/wiki/Trajan 'Trajan'), [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian 'Hadrian'), [Antoninus Pius](/wiki/Antoninus_Pius 'Antoninus Pius'), and [Marcus Aurelius](/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius 'Marcus Aurelius').

### Fall in the West and survival in the East

See also: [Barbarian kingdoms](/wiki/Barbarian_kingdoms 'Barbarian kingdoms') and [Byzantine Empire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire 'Byzantine Empire')

In the view of contemporary Greek historian [Cassius Dio](/wiki/Cassius_Dio 'Cassius Dio'), the accession of [Commodus](/wiki/Commodus 'Commodus') in 180 marked the descent \"from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron\"---a comment which has led some historians, notably [Edward Gibbon](/wiki/Edward_Gibbon 'Edward Gibbon'), to take Commodus\' reign as the beginning of the [Empire\'s decline](/wiki/Historiography_of_the_fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire 'Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire').

In 212, during the reign of [Caracalla](/wiki/Caracalla 'Caracalla'), [Roman citizenship](/wiki/Roman_citizenship 'Roman citizenship') was granted to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. The [Severan dynasty](/wiki/Severan_dynasty 'Severan dynasty') was tumultuous---an emperor\'s reign was ended routinely by his murder or execution---and, following its collapse, the Empire was engulfed by the [Crisis of the Third Century](/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century 'Crisis of the Third Century'), a period of [invasions](/wiki/Invasion 'Invasion'), [civil strife](/wiki/Civil_strife 'Civil strife'), [economic disorder](/wiki/Economic_collapse 'Economic collapse'), and [plague](/wiki/Plague_of_Cyprian 'Plague of Cyprian'). In defining [historical epochs](/wiki/Periodization 'Periodization'), this crisis sometimes marks the transition from [Classical](/wiki/Classical_Antiquity 'Classical Antiquity') to [Late Antiquity](/wiki/Late_Antiquity 'Late Antiquity'). [Aurelian](/wiki/Aurelian 'Aurelian') stabilized the empire and [Diocletian](/wiki/Diocletian 'Diocletian') completed the work of fully restoring it in 285, but rejected the role of _princeps_ and assumed the title of _dominus_ (\"lord\"), thus starting the period known as the [Dominate](/wiki/Dominate 'Dominate'). Diocletian\'s reign brought the empire\'s most concerted effort against the perceived threat of [Christianity](/wiki/Early_Christianity 'Early Christianity'), the [\"Great Persecution\"](/wiki/Diocletianic_Persecution 'Diocletianic Persecution').

Diocletian divided the empire into four regions, each ruled by a separate [tetrarch](/wiki/Tetrarchy 'Tetrarchy'). Confident that he fixed the disorder plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, but the Tetrarchy [collapsed shortly after](/wiki/Civil_wars_of_the_Tetrarchy 'Civil wars of the Tetrarchy'). Order was eventually restored by [Constantine the Great](/wiki/Constantine_the_Great 'Constantine the Great'), who became the first emperor to [convert to Christianity](/wiki/Constantine_the_Great_and_Christianity 'Constantine the Great and Christianity'), and who established [Constantinople](/wiki/Constantinople 'Constantinople') as the new capital of the Eastern Empire. During the decades of the [Constantinian](/wiki/Constantinian_dynasty 'Constantinian dynasty') and [Valentinian](/wiki/Valentinian_dynasty 'Valentinian dynasty') dynasties, the empire was divided along an east--west axis, with dual power centres in Constantinople and Rome. [Julian](</wiki/Julian_(emperor)> 'Julian (emperor)'), who under the influence of his adviser [Mardonius](</wiki/Mardonius_(philosopher)> 'Mardonius (philosopher)') attempted to restore [Classical Roman](/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome 'Religion in ancient Rome') and [Hellenistic religion](/wiki/Hellenistic_religion 'Hellenistic religion'), only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. [Theodosius I](/wiki/Theodosius_I 'Theodosius I'), the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 after making Christianity the [state religion](/wiki/State_church_of_the_Roman_Empire 'State church of the Roman Empire').

The [Western Roman Empire](/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire 'Western Roman Empire') began to [disintegrate](/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire 'Fall of the Western Roman Empire') in the early 5th century. The Romans were successful in fighting off all invaders, most famously [Attila](/wiki/Attila 'Attila'), but the empire had [assimilated so many Germanic peoples](/wiki/Migration_Period 'Migration Period') of dubious loyalty to Rome that the empire started to dismember itself. [Most chronologies](/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire 'Fall of the Western Roman Empire') place the end of the Western Roman Empire in 476, when [Romulus Augustulus](/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus 'Romulus Augustulus') was [forced to abdicate](/wiki/Deposition_of_Romulus_Augustulus 'Deposition of Romulus Augustulus') to the [Germanic](/wiki/Germanic_peoples 'Germanic peoples') warlord [Odoacer](/wiki/Odoacer 'Odoacer').

Odoacer ended the Western Empire by declaring [Zeno](</wiki/Zeno_(emperor)> 'Zeno (emperor)') sole emperor and placing himself as Zeno\'s nominal subordinate. In reality, Italy was ruled by Odoacer alone. The Eastern Roman Empire, called the [Byzantine Empire](/wiki/Byzantine_Empire 'Byzantine Empire') by later historians, continued until the reign of [Constantine XI Palaiologos](/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos 'Constantine XI Palaiologos'). The last Roman emperor died in battle in 1453 against [Mehmed II](/wiki/Mehmed_II 'Mehmed II') and his [Ottoman](/wiki/Ottoman_Empire 'Ottoman Empire') forces during the [siege of Constantinople](/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople 'Fall of Constantinople'). Mehmed II adopted the title of _[caesar](/wiki/Kayser-i_R%C3%BBm 'Kayser-i Rûm')_ in an attempt to claim a connection to the Empire.

## Geography and demography

Main articles: [Demography of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Demography_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Demography of the Roman Empire') and [Borders of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Borders_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Borders of the Roman Empire')

Further information: [Classical demography](/wiki/Classical_demography 'Classical demography')

The Roman Empire was [one of the largest](/wiki/List_of_largest_empires 'List of largest empires') in history, with contiguous territories throughout Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The Latin phrase _imperium sine fine_ (\"empire without end\") expressed the ideology that neither time nor space limited the Empire. In [Virgil](/wiki/Virgil 'Virgil')\'s _[Aeneid](/wiki/Aeneid 'Aeneid'),_ limitless empire is said to be granted to the Romans by [Jupiter](</wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)> 'Jupiter (mythology)'). This claim of universal dominion was renewed when the Empire came under Christian rule in the 4th century. In addition to annexing large regions, the Romans directly altered their geography, for example [cutting down entire forests](/wiki/Deforestation_during_the_Roman_period 'Deforestation during the Roman period').

[Roman expansion](/wiki/Campaign_history_of_the_Roman_military 'Campaign history of the Roman military') was mostly accomplished under the [Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic 'Roman Republic'), though parts of northern Europe were conquered in the 1st century, when Roman control in Europe, Africa, and Asia was strengthened. Under [Augustus](/wiki/Augustus 'Augustus'), a \"global map of the known world\" was displayed for the first time in public at Rome, coinciding with the creation of the most comprehensive [political geography](/wiki/Political_geography 'Political geography') that survives from antiquity, the _[Geography](/wiki/Geographica 'Geographica')_ of [Strabo](/wiki/Strabo 'Strabo'). When Augustus died, the account of his achievements _([Res Gestae](/wiki/Res_Gestae_Divi_Augusti 'Res Gestae Divi Augusti'))_ prominently featured the geographical cataloguing of the Empire. Geography alongside meticulous written records were central concerns of [Roman Imperial administration](#Central_government).

The Empire reached its largest expanse under [Trajan](/wiki/Trajan 'Trajan'), encompassing 5 million square kilometres. The traditional population estimate of [55--60 million] inhabitants accounted for between one-sixth and one-fourth of the world\'s total population and made it the most populous unified political entity in the West until the mid-19th century. Recent [demographic studies](/wiki/Classical_demography#Demography_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Classical demography') have argued for a population peak from [70 million] to more than [100 million]. Each of the three largest cities in the Empire -- Rome, [Alexandria](/wiki/Alexandria 'Alexandria'), and [Antioch](/wiki/Antioch 'Antioch') -- was almost twice the size of any European city at the beginning of the 17th century.

As the historian [Christopher Kelly](</wiki/Christopher_Kelly_(historian)> 'Christopher Kelly (historian)') described it:

> Then the empire stretched from [Hadrian\'s Wall](/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall "Hadrian's Wall") in drizzle-soaked [northern England](/wiki/Northern_England 'Northern England') to the sun-baked banks of the [Euphrates](/wiki/Euphrates 'Euphrates') in Syria; from the great [Rhine](/wiki/Rhine 'Rhine')--[Danube](/wiki/Danube 'Danube') river system, which snaked across the fertile, flat lands of Europe from the [Low Countries](/wiki/Low_Countries 'Low Countries') to the [Black Sea](/wiki/Black_Sea 'Black Sea'), to the rich plains of the North African coast and the luxuriant gash of the [Nile Valley](/wiki/Nile_Valley 'Nile Valley') in Egypt. The empire completely circled the [Mediterranean](/wiki/Mediterranean 'Mediterranean') \... referred to by its conquerors as _[mare nostrum](/wiki/Mare_nostrum 'Mare nostrum')_---\'our sea\'.

Trajan\'s successor [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian 'Hadrian') adopted a policy of maintaining rather than expanding the empire. Borders _(fines)_ were marked, and the frontiers _([limites](</wiki/Limes_(Roman*Empire)> 'Limes (Roman Empire)'))* patrolled. The most heavily fortified borders were the most unstable. [Hadrian\'s Wall](/wiki/Hadrian%27s_Wall "Hadrian's Wall"), which separated the Roman world from what was perceived as an ever-present [barbarian](/wiki/Barbarian 'Barbarian') threat, is the primary surviving monument of this effort.

## Languages

Main article: [Languages of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Languages_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Languages of the Roman Empire')

See also: [Jireček Line](/wiki/Jire%C4%8Dek_Line 'Jireček Line')

Latin and Greek were the main languages of the Empire, but the Empire was deliberately multilingual. [Andrew Wallace-Hadrill](/wiki/Andrew_Wallace-Hadrill 'Andrew Wallace-Hadrill') says \"The main desire of the Roman government was to make itself understood\". At the start of the Empire, knowledge of Greek was useful to pass as educated nobility and knowledge of Latin was useful for a career in the military, government, or law. Bilingual inscriptions indicate the everyday interpenetration of the two languages.

Latin and Greek\'s mutual linguistic and cultural influence is a complex topic. Latin words incorporated into Greek were very common by the early imperial era, especially for military, administration, and trade and commerce matters. Greek grammar, literature, poetry and philosophy shaped Latin language and culture.

There was never a legal requirement for Latin in the Empire, but it represented a certain status. High standards of Latin, _[Latinitas](/wiki/Classical_Latin 'Classical Latin')_, started with the advent of Latin literature. Due to the flexible language policy of the Empire, a natural competition of language emerged that spurred _Latinitas_, to defend Latin against the stronger cultural influence of Greek. Over time Latin usage was used to project power and a higher social class. Different emperors up until Justinian would attempt to require the use of Latin in various sections of the administration but there is no evidence that a linguistic imperialism existed during the early Empire.

After all freeborn inhabitants were universally [enfranchised](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enfranchise 'wikt:enfranchise') in [212](/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana 'Constitutio Antoniniana'), many Roman citizens would have lacked a knowledge of Latin. The wide use of [Koine Greek](/wiki/Koine_Greek 'Koine Greek') was what enabled the spread of Christianity and reflects its role as the [lingua franca](/wiki/Lingua_franca 'Lingua franca') of the Mediterranean during the time of the Empire. Following Diocletian\'s reforms in the 3rd century CE, there was a decline in the knowledge of Greek in the west. Spoken Latin later fragmented into the incipient [romance languages](/wiki/Romance_languages 'Romance languages') in the 7th century CE following the collapse of the Empire\'s west.

The dominance of Latin and Greek among the literate elite obscure the continuity of other spoken languages within the Empire. Latin, referred to in its spoken form as [Vulgar Latin](/wiki/Vulgar_Latin 'Vulgar Latin'), gradually replaced [Celtic](/wiki/Celtic_languages 'Celtic languages') and [Italic languages](/wiki/Italic_languages 'Italic languages'). References to interpreters indicate the continuing use of local languages, particularly in Egypt with [Coptic](/wiki/Coptic_language 'Coptic language'), and in military settings along the Rhine and Danube. Roman [jurists](/wiki/Jurist 'Jurist') also show a concern for local languages such as [Punic](/wiki/Punic_language 'Punic language'), [Gaulish](/wiki/Gaulish_language 'Gaulish language'), and [Aramaic](/wiki/Aramaic 'Aramaic') in assuring the correct understanding of laws and oaths. In [Africa](</wiki/Africa_(Roman_province)> 'Africa (Roman province)'), Libyco-Berber and Punic were used in inscriptions into the 2nd century. In [Syria](</wiki/Syria_(Roman_province)> 'Syria (Roman province)'), [Palmyrene](/wiki/Palmyra 'Palmyra') soldiers used their [dialect of Aramaic](/wiki/Palmyrene_dialect 'Palmyrene dialect') for inscriptions, an exception to the rule that Latin was the language of the military. The last reference to Gaulish was between 560 and 575. The emergent [Gallo-Romance languages](/wiki/Gallo-Romance_languages 'Gallo-Romance languages') would then be shaped by Gaulish [Proto-Basque](/wiki/Proto-Basque_language 'Proto-Basque language') or [Aquitanian](/wiki/Aquitanian_language 'Aquitanian language') evolved with Latin loan words to modern [Basque](/wiki/Basque_language 'Basque language').The [Thracian language](/wiki/Thracian_language 'Thracian language'), as were several now-extinct languages in Anatolia are attested in Imperial-era inscriptions.

## Society

Further information: [Ancient Roman society](/wiki/Ancient_Roman_society 'Ancient Roman society')

The Empire was remarkably multicultural, with \"astonishing cohesive capacity\" to create shared identity while encompassing diverse peoples. Public monuments and communal spaces open to all---such as [forums](</wiki/Forum_(Roman)> 'Forum (Roman)'), [amphitheatres](/wiki/List_of_Roman_amphitheatres 'List of Roman amphitheatres'), [racetracks](</wiki/Circus_(building)> 'Circus (building)') and [baths](/wiki/Thermae 'Thermae')---helped foster a sense of \"Romanness\".

Roman society had multiple, overlapping [social hierarchies](/wiki/Social_class_in_ancient_Rome 'Social class in ancient Rome'). The civil war preceding Augustus caused upheaval, but did not effect an immediate [redistribution of wealth](/wiki/Redistribution_of_wealth 'Redistribution of wealth') and social power. From the perspective of the lower classes, a peak was merely added to the social pyramid. Personal relationships---[patronage](/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome 'Patronage in ancient Rome'), friendship _(amicitia)_, [family](/wiki/Family_in_ancient_Rome 'Family in ancient Rome'), [marriage](/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome 'Marriage in ancient Rome')---continued to influence politics. By the time of [Nero](/wiki/Nero 'Nero'), however, it was not unusual to find a former slave who was richer than a freeborn citizen, or an [equestrian](/wiki/Equestrian_order 'Equestrian order') who exercised greater power than a senator.

The blurring of the Republic\'s more rigid hierarchies led to increased [social mobility](/wiki/Social_mobility 'Social mobility'), both upward and downward, to a greater extent than all other well-documented ancient societies. Women, freedmen, and slaves had opportunities to profit and exercise influence in ways previously less available to them. Social life, particularly for those whose personal resources were limited, was further fostered by a proliferation of [voluntary associations](/wiki/Associations_in_Ancient_Rome 'Associations in Ancient Rome') and [confraternities](/wiki/Confraternity 'Confraternity') (_[collegia](/wiki/Collegium 'Collegium')_ and _[sodalitates](/wiki/Sodales 'Sodales')_): professional and trade guilds, veterans\' groups, religious sodalities, drinking and dining clubs, performing troupes, and [burial societies](/wiki/Burial_society 'Burial society').

### Legal status

Main articles: [Status in Roman legal system](/wiki/Status_in_Roman_legal_system 'Status in Roman legal system') and [Roman citizenship](/wiki/Roman_citizenship 'Roman citizenship')

According to the [jurist Gaius](</wiki/Gaius_(jurist)> 'Gaius (jurist)'), the essential distinction in the Roman \"[law of persons](/wiki/Legal_personality 'Legal personality')\" was that all humans were either free _(liberi)_ or slaves _(servi)_. The legal status of free persons was further defined by their citizenship. Most citizens held limited rights (such as the _[ius Latinum](/wiki/Ius_Latinum 'Ius Latinum'),_ \"Latin right\"), but were entitled to legal protections and privileges not enjoyed by non-citizens. Free people not considered citizens, but living within the Roman world, were _[peregrini](</wiki/Peregrinus_(Roman)> 'Peregrinus (Roman)')_, non-Romans. In 212, the _[Constitutio Antoniniana](/wiki/Constitutio_Antoniniana 'Constitutio Antoniniana')\_ extended citizenship to all freeborn inhabitants of the empire. This legal egalitarianism required a far-reaching revision of existing laws that distinguished between citizens and non-citizens.

#### Women in Roman law

Main article: [Women in ancient Rome](/wiki/Women_in_ancient_Rome 'Women in ancient Rome')

Freeborn Roman women were considered citizens, but did not vote, hold political office, or serve in the military. A mother\'s citizen status determined that of her children, as indicated by the phrase _ex duobus civibus Romanis natos_ (\"children born of two Roman citizens\"). A Roman woman kept her own [family name](/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions 'Roman naming conventions') _(nomen)_ for life. Children most often took the father\'s name, with some exceptions. Women could own property, enter contracts, and engage in business. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could hold considerable fortunes.

The archaic [_manus_ marriage](/wiki/Manus_marriage 'Manus marriage') in which the woman was subject to her husband\'s authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father\'s legal authority, even though she moved into her husband\'s home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated. This arrangement was a factor in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed compared to many other cultures up to the modern period: although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in daily life, and her husband had no legal power over her. Although it was a point of pride to be a \"one-man woman\" _(univira)_ who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to [divorce](/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome#Divorce 'Marriage in ancient Rome'), nor to speedy remarriage after being widowed or divorced. Girls had equal inheritance rights with boys if their father died without leaving a will. A mother\'s right to own and dispose of property, including setting the terms of her will, gave her enormous influence over her sons into adulthood.

As part of the Augustan programme to restore traditional morality and social order, [moral legislation](/wiki/Leges_Iuliae 'Leges Iuliae') attempted to regulate conduct as a means of promoting \"[family values](/wiki/Family_values 'Family values')\". [Adultery](/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome#Adultery 'Marriage in ancient Rome') was criminalized, and defined broadly as an illicit sex act _([stuprum](/wiki/Stuprum 'Stuprum'))_ between a male citizen and a married woman, or between a married woman and any man other than her husband. That is, a [double standard](/wiki/Double_standard 'Double standard') was in place: a married woman could have sex only with her husband, but a married man did not commit adultery if he had sex with a prostitute or person of marginalized status. Childbearing was encouraged: a woman who had given birth to three children was granted symbolic honours and greater legal freedom (the _[ius trium liberorum](/wiki/Ius_trium_liberorum 'Ius trium liberorum'))_.

#### Slaves and the law

Main article: [Slavery in ancient Rome](/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome 'Slavery in ancient Rome')

At the time of Augustus, as many as 35% of the people in [Roman Italy](/wiki/Roman_Italy 'Roman Italy') were slaves, making Rome one of five historical \"slave societies\" in which slaves constituted at least a fifth of the population and played a major role in the economy. Slavery was a complex institution that supported traditional Roman social structures as well as contributing economic utility. In urban settings, slaves might be professionals such as teachers, physicians, chefs, and accountants; the majority of slaves provided trained or unskilled labour. [Agriculture](/wiki/Agriculture_in_ancient_Rome 'Agriculture in ancient Rome') and industry, such as milling and mining, relied on the exploitation of slaves. Outside Italy, slaves were on average an estimated 10 to 20% of the population, sparse in [Roman Egypt](/wiki/Roman_Egypt 'Roman Egypt') but more concentrated in some Greek areas. Expanding Roman ownership of arable land and industries affected preexisting practices of slavery in the provinces. Although slavery has often been regarded as waning in the 3rd and 4th centuries, it remained an integral part of Roman society until gradually ceasing in the 6th and 7th centuries with the disintegration of the complex Imperial economy.

Laws pertaining to slavery were \"extremely intricate\". Slaves were considered property and had no [legal personhood](</wiki/Person_(law)> 'Person (law)'). They could be subjected to forms of corporal punishment not normally exercised on citizens, [sexual exploitation](/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome#Master-slave_relations 'Sexuality in ancient Rome'), torture, and [summary execution](/wiki/Summary_execution 'Summary execution'). A slave could not as a matter of law be raped; a slave\'s rapist had to be prosecuted by the owner for property damage under the [Aquilian Law](/wiki/Lex_Aquilia 'Lex Aquilia'). Slaves had no right to the form of legal marriage called _[conubium](/wiki/Marriage_in_ancient_Rome 'Marriage in ancient Rome')_, but their unions were sometimes recognized. Technically, a slave could not own property, but a slave who conducted business might be given access to an individual fund _(peculium)_ that he could use, depending on the degree of trust and co-operation between owner and slave. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave acting as the master of others. Talented slaves might accumulate a large enough _peculium_ to justify their freedom, or be [manumitted](/wiki/Manumission 'Manumission') for services rendered. Manumission had become frequent enough that in 2 BC a law _([Lex Fufia Caninia](/wiki/Lex_Fufia_Caninia 'Lex Fufia Caninia'))_ limited the number of slaves an owner was allowed to free in his will.

Following the [Servile Wars](/wiki/Servile_Wars 'Servile Wars') of the Republic, legislation under Augustus and his successors shows a driving concern for controlling the threat of rebellions through limiting the size of work groups, and for hunting down fugitive slaves. Over time slaves gained increased legal protection, including the right to file complaints against their masters. A bill of sale might contain a clause stipulating that the slave could not be employed for prostitution, as [prostitutes in ancient Rome](/wiki/Prostitution_in_ancient_Rome 'Prostitution in ancient Rome') were often slaves. The burgeoning trade in [eunuchs](/wiki/Eunuch 'Eunuch') in the late 1st century prompted legislation that prohibited the [castration](/wiki/Sexuality_in_ancient_Rome#Castration_and_circumcision 'Sexuality in ancient Rome') of a slave against his will \"for lust or gain.\"

Roman slavery was not based on [race](</wiki/Race_(human_categorization)> 'Race (human categorization)'). Generally, slaves in Italy were indigenous Italians, with a minority of foreigners (including both slaves and freedmen) estimated at 5% of the total in the capital at its peak, where their number was largest. Foreign slaves had higher mortality and lower birth rates than natives, and were sometimes even subjected to mass expulsions. The average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of Rome was seventeen and a half years (17.2 for males; 17.9 for females).

During the period of republican expansionism when slavery had become pervasive, war captives were a main source of slaves. The range of ethnicities among slaves to some extent reflected that of the armies Rome defeated in war, and the [conquest of Greece](/wiki/Greece_in_the_Roman_era 'Greece in the Roman era') brought a number of highly skilled and educated slaves. Slaves were also traded in markets and sometimes sold by [pirates](/wiki/Cilician_pirates 'Cilician pirates'). [Infant abandonment](/wiki/Child_abandonment 'Child abandonment') and self-enslavement among the poor were other sources. _Vernae_, by contrast, were \"homegrown\" slaves born to female slaves within the household, estate or farm. Although they had no special legal status, an owner who mistreated or failed to care for his _vernae_ faced social disapproval, as they were considered part of the family household and in some cases might actually be the children of free males in the family.

#### Freedmen

Rome differed from [Greek city-states](/wiki/Greek_city-states 'Greek city-states') in allowing freed slaves to become citizens; any future children of a freedman were born free, with full rights of citizenship. After manumission, a slave who had belonged to a Roman citizen enjoyed active political freedom _(libertas)_, including the right to vote. His former master became his patron _([patronus](/wiki/Patronage_in_ancient_Rome 'Patronage in ancient Rome'))_: the two continued to have customary and legal obligations to each other. A freedman was not entitled to hold public office or the highest state priesthoods, but could play a [priestly role](/wiki/Augustales 'Augustales'). He could not marry a woman from a senatorial family, nor achieve legitimate senatorial rank himself, but during the early Empire, freedmen held key positions in the government bureaucracy, so much so that [Hadrian](/wiki/Hadrian 'Hadrian') limited their participation by law. The rise of successful freedmen---through political influence or wealth---is a characteristic of early Imperial society. The prosperity of a high-achieving group of freedmen is attested by [inscriptions throughout the Empire](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Liberti_and_libertae_in_Ancient_Roman_inscriptions 'commons:Category:Liberti and libertae in Ancient Roman inscriptions'), and by their ownership of some of the most lavish houses at [Pompeii](/wiki/Pompeii 'Pompeii').

### Census rank

See also: [Senate of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Senate of the Roman Empire'), [Equestrian order](/wiki/Equestrian_order 'Equestrian order'), and [Decurion (administrative)](</wiki/Decurion_(administrative)> 'Decurion (administrative)')

The Latin word _ordo_ (plural _ordines_) is translated variously and inexactly into English as \"class, order, rank\". One purpose of the [Roman census](/wiki/Roman_census 'Roman census') was to determine the _ordo_ to which an individual belonged. The two highest _ordines_ in Rome were the senatorial and equestrian. Outside Rome, the [decurions](</wiki/Decurion_(administrative)> 'Decurion (administrative)'), also known as _[curiales](/wiki/Curiales 'Curiales')_, were the top governing _ordo_ of an individual city.

\"Senator\" was not itself an elected office in ancient Rome; an individual gained admission to the Senate after he had been elected to and served at least one term as an [executive magistrate](/wiki/Executive_magistrates_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Executive magistrates of the Roman Empire'). A senator also had to meet a minimum property requirement of 1 million _[sestertii](/wiki/Sestertii 'Sestertii')_. Not all men who qualified for the _ordo senatorius_ chose to take a Senate seat, which required [legal domicile](</wiki/Domicile_(law)> 'Domicile (law)') at Rome. Emperors often filled vacancies in the 600-member body by appointment. A senator\'s son belonged to the _ordo senatorius_, but he had to qualify on his own merits for admission to the Senate. A senator could be removed for violating moral standards.

In the time of Nero, senators were still primarily from [Italy](</wiki/Italy_(Roman_Empire)> 'Italy (Roman Empire)'), with some from the Iberian peninsula and southern France; men from the Greek-speaking provinces of the East began to be added under Vespasian. The first senator from the easternmost province, [Cappadocia](</wiki/Cappadocia_(Roman_province)> 'Cappadocia (Roman province)'), was admitted under Marcus Aurelius. By the [Severan dynasty](/wiki/Severan_dynasty 'Severan dynasty') (193--235), Italians made up less than half the Senate. During the 3rd century, domicile at Rome became impractical, and inscriptions attest to senators who were active in politics and munificence in their homeland _(patria)_.

Senators were the traditional governing class who rose through the _[cursus honorum](/wiki/Cursus_honorum 'Cursus honorum')_, the political career track, but equestrians often possessed greater wealth and political power. Membership in the equestrian order was based on property; in Rome\'s early days, _equites_ or knights had been distinguished by their ability to serve as mounted warriors, but cavalry service was a separate function in the Empire. A census valuation of 400,000 sesterces and three generations of free birth qualified a man as an equestrian. The census of 28 BC uncovered large numbers of men who qualified, and in 14 AD, a thousand equestrians were registered at [Cadiz](/wiki/Cadiz 'Cadiz') and [Padua](/wiki/Padua 'Padua') alone. Equestrians rose through a military career track _([tres militiae](/wiki/Tres_militiae 'Tres militiae'))_ to become highly placed [prefects](/wiki/Prefect 'Prefect') and [procurators](</wiki/Procurator_(Roman)> 'Procurator (Roman)') within the Imperial administration.

The rise of provincial men to the senatorial and equestrian orders is an aspect of social mobility in the early Empire. Roman aristocracy was based on competition, and unlike later [European nobility](/wiki/European_nobility 'European nobility'), a Roman family could not maintain its position merely through hereditary succession or having title to lands. Admission to the higher _ordines_ brought distinction and privileges, but also responsibilities. In antiquity, a city depended on its leading citizens to fund public works, events, and services _([munera](</wiki/Munera_(ancient*Rome)> 'Munera (ancient Rome)'))*. Maintaining one\'s rank required massive personal expenditures. Decurions were so vital for the functioning of cities that in the later Empire, as the ranks of the town councils became depleted, those who had risen to the Senate were encouraged to return to their hometowns, in an effort to sustain civic life.

In the later Empire, the _[dignitas](</wiki/Dignitas_(Roman*concept)> 'Dignitas (Roman concept)')* (\"worth, esteem\") that attended on senatorial or equestrian rank was refined further with titles such as _[vir illustris](/wiki/Vir_illustris 'Vir illustris')_ (\"illustrious man\"). The appellation _clarissimus_ (Greek _lamprotatos_) was used to designate the _[dignitas](</wiki/Dignitas_(Roman*concept)> 'Dignitas (Roman concept)')* of certain senators and their immediate family, including women. \"Grades\" of equestrian status proliferated.

#### Unequal justice

As the republican principle of citizens\' equality under the law faded, the symbolic and social privileges of the upper classes led to an informal division of Roman society into those who had acquired greater honours _(honestiores)_ and humbler folk _(humiliores)_. In general, _honestiores_ were the members of the three higher \"orders,\" along with certain military officers. The granting of universal citizenship in 212 seems to have increased the competitive urge among the upper classes to have their superiority affirmed, particularly within the justice system. Sentencing depended on the judgment of the presiding official as to the relative \"worth\" _(dignitas)_ of the defendant: an _honestior_ could pay a fine for a crime for which an _humilior_ might receive a [scourging](/wiki/Scourging 'Scourging').

Execution, which was an infrequent legal penalty for free men under the Republic, could be quick and relatively painless for _honestiores_, while _humiliores_ might suffer the kinds of torturous death previously reserved for slaves, such as [crucifixion](/wiki/Crucifixion 'Crucifixion') and [condemnation to the beasts](/wiki/Damnatio_ad_bestias 'Damnatio ad bestias'). In the early Empire, those who converted to Christianity could lose their standing as _honestiores_, especially if they declined to fulfil religious responsibilities, and thus became subject to punishments that created the conditions of [martyrdom](/wiki/Christian_martyrs 'Christian martyrs').

## Government and military

Main article: [Constitution of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Constitution of the Roman Empire')

The three major elements of the Imperial state were the central government, the military, and the provincial government. The military established control of a territory through war, but after a city or people was brought under treaty, the mission turned to policing: protecting Roman citizens, agricultural fields, and religious sites. The Romans lacked sufficient manpower or resources to rule through force alone. [Cooperation with local elites](</wiki/Local_government_(ancient_Roman)> 'Local government (ancient Roman)') was necessary to maintain order, collect information, and extract revenue. The Romans often exploited internal political divisions.

Communities with demonstrated loyalty to Rome retained their own laws, could collect their own taxes locally, and in exceptional cases were exempt from Roman taxation. Legal privileges and relative independence incentivized compliance. Roman government was thus [limited](/wiki/Limited_government 'Limited government'), but efficient in its use of available resources.

### Central government

See also: [Roman emperor](/wiki/Roman_emperor 'Roman emperor') and [Senate of the Roman Empire](/wiki/Senate_of_the_Roman_Empire 'Senate of the Roman Empire')

The [Imperial cult of ancient Rome](</wiki/Imperial_cult_(ancient_Rome)> 'Imperial cult (ancient Rome)') identified [emperors](/wiki/Roman_emperor 'Roman emperor') and some members of their families with [divinely sanctioned](/wiki/Divine_right_of_kings 'Divine right of kings') authority (_[auctoritas](/wiki/Auctoritas 'Auctoritas')_). The rite of [apotheosis](/wiki/Apotheosis 'Apotheosis') (also called _consecratio_) signified the deceased emperor\'s deification. The dominance of the emperor was based on the consolidation of powers from several republican offices. The emperor made himself the central religious authority as _[pontifex maximus](/wiki/Pontifex_maximus 'Pontifex maximus')_, and centralized the right to declare war, ratify treaties, and negotiate with foreign leaders. While these functions were clearly defined during the [Principate](/wiki/Principate 'Principate'), the emperor\'s powers over time became less constitutional and more monarchical, culminating in the [Dominate](/wiki/Dominate 'Dominate').

The emperor was the ultimate authority in policy- and decision-making, but in the early Principate, he was expected to be accessible and deal personally with official business and petitions. A bureaucracy formed around him only gradually. The Julio-Claudian emperors relied on an informal body of advisors that included not only senators and equestrians, but trusted slaves and freedmen. After Nero, the influence of the latter was regarded with suspicion, and the emperor\'s council _(consilium)_ became subject to official appointment for greater [transparency](/wiki/Open_government 'Open government'). Though the Senate took a lead in policy discussions until the end of the [Antonine dynasty](/wiki/Antonine_dynasty 'Antonine dynasty'), equestrians played an increasingly important role in the _consilium._ The women of the emperor\'s family often intervened directly in his decisions.

Access to the emperor might be gained at the daily reception _(salutatio)_, a development of the traditional homage a client paid to his patron; public banquets hosted at the palace; and religious ceremonies. The common people who lacked this access could manifest their approval or displeasure as a group at [games](#Spectacles). By the 4th century, the Christian emperors became remote figureheads who issued general rulings, no longer responding to individual petitions. Although the Senate could do little short of assassination and open rebellion to contravene the will of the emperor, it retained its symbolic political centrality. The Senate legitimated the emperor\'s rule, and the emperor employed senators as legates _([legati](/wiki/Legatus 'Legatus'))_: generals, diplomats, and administrators.

The practical source of an emperor\'s power and authority was the military. The [legionaries](/wiki/Legionary 'Legionary') were paid by the Imperial treasury, and swore an annual [oath of loyalty](</wiki/Sacramentum_(oath)> 'Sacramentum (oath)') to the emperor. Most emperors chose a successor, usually a close family member or [adopted](/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome 'Adoption in ancient Rome') heir. The new emperor had to seek a swift acknowledgement of his status and authority to stabilize the political landscape. No emperor could hope to survive without the allegiance of the [Praetorian Guard](/wiki/Praetorian_Guard 'Praetorian Guard') and the legions. To secure their loyalty, several emperors paid the _[donativum](/wiki/Donativum 'Donativum')_, a monetary reward. In theory, the Senate was entitled to choose the new emperor, but did so mindful of acclamation by the army or Praetorians.
